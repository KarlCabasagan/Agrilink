Before applying any changes, thoroughly review all files connected to the user’s request to understand the full context. When adding functionality, always check for existing functions first and reuse them when possible to prevent duplication. Use updated_database.sql as the authoritative source for the database schema, and do not reference or assume any tables or columns that are not explicitly defined in it. For UI-related work, ensure all components strictly follow the existing design system and maintain visual and behavioral consistency across the interface.
When modifying text displayed to users, ensure the language is clear, concise, and maintains a consistent tone throughout the application. Always test changes to verify that they work as intended and do not introduce new issues. After completing the changes, review the entire code for adherence to best practices, including code readability, maintainability, and performance optimization.
